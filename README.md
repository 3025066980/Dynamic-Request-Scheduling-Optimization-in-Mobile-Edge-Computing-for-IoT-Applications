This paper tackles two main problems:

1. Uplink Power Allocation Problem (PA)
Objective: Minimize transmitting energy consumption
Author’s solution: Non-Cooperative Game Model Based On Subgradient (NCGG)
My implementation: Inertia Weighted Particle Swarm Optimisation

2. Joint Resource Offloading And Computing Resource Scheduling Problem (JRORS)
Author’s solution: Multiple-Objective Optimization i-NSGA-II (MO-NSGA)
My implementation: Binary Particle Swarm Optimisation
